- Price staleness checks (5-minute maximum age)
- Balance validation before conditional execution

### Contract Security

- Reentrancy protection compatible with multicall
- Emergency pause mechanism
- Token recovery functions for stuck assets
- ERC-1271 contract signature validation

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### Reporting Process

1. **Email**: Send vulnerability details to `security@tetrics.com`
2. **Subject Line**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`
3. **Content**: Include:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)
   - Your contact information for follow-up

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates until resolved
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity (see below)

### Severity Levels

| Severity     | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| **Critical** | 24 hours      | 7 days       |
| **High**     | 48 hours      | 14 days      |
| **Medium**   | 5 days        | 30 days      |
| **Low**      | 10 days       | 90 days      |

**Critical**: Funds at immediate risk, contract exploit possible **High**:
Significant economic loss possible under specific conditions **Medium**: Minor
economic loss or degraded functionality **Low**: Informational, best practice
recommendations

### Bug Bounty Program

üéØ **Bug Bounty Program**: COMING SOON

We plan to launch a bug bounty program on:

- Immunefi
- Code4rena
- HackerOne

Rewards will be based on:

- **Critical**: Up to $50,000
- **High**: Up to $10,000
- **Medium**: Up to $2,000
- **Low**: Up to $500

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report privately to security@tetrics.com
2. **Assessment Period**: 90 days maximum for assessment and fix
3. **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to upgrade
4. **Credit**: Security researchers will be credited (unless anonymous
   requested)

### Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Issues in third-party contracts (Lido, Morpho, etc.)
- Blockchain-level vulnerabilities
- Known issues already reported
- Social engineering attacks
- Gas optimization suggestions (unless security-critical)

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **No Upgradeability**: Contracts are immutable - migration required for
   upgrades
2. **Oracle Dependency**: Relies on RedStone oracle availability
3. **Cross-Chain Risks**: Bridge failures can result in stuck funds
4. **Price Oracle Attacks**: MEV/sandwich attacks possible despite slippage
   protection

### Acknowledged Risks

- **Smart Contract Risk**: All DeFi protocols carry inherent smart contract risk
- **Composability Risk**: Failures in underlying protocols (Lido, Morpho, etc.)
- **Oracle Risk**: Price feed manipulation or downtime
- **Governance Risk**: Multi-sig key management and potential compromise

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Before Using Tetrics

‚úÖ **Do:**

- Start with small amounts to test functionality
- Verify all transaction details before signing
- Use hardware wallets for production usage
- Understand slippage and price impact
- Monitor transaction status on block explorers
- Keep private keys secure and offline
- Review contract addresses before interacting

‚ùå **Don't:**

- Use the protocol with funds you can't afford to lose
- Share private keys or seed phrases
- Sign transactions without reviewing parameters
- Assume testnet behavior matches mainnet
- Interact with unverified contract addresses

### Operational Security

For protocol operators:

- Use multi-sig wallets for all admin operations
- Implement key rotation policies
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Maintain emergency response procedures
- Regular security training for team members

## Security Monitoring

### On-Chain Monitoring

We recommend monitoring:

- Unusual transaction patterns
- Large deposits/withdrawals
- Failed transactions
- Oracle price deviations
- Contract pause events

### Recommended Tools

- **Tenderly**: Transaction simulation and alerts
- **Forta**: Real-time threat detection
- **OpenZeppelin Defender**: Automated monitoring and operations
- **Etherscan**: Contract verification and transaction tracking

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate**: Emergency pause activated
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates impact
3. **Communication**: Users notified via official channels
4. **Mitigation**: Fix deployed or migration initiated
5. **Post-Mortem**: Public incident report published
